## 6.2 UserService Testing Implementation

In this section, we implemented comprehensive testing for the UserService layer using Mockito. Here's what we accomplished:

1. **Service Layer Testing Setup**
   - Created UserService interface
   - Created UserServiceImpl to implement the interface
   - Implemented UserRepository for data persistence
   - Set up mock testing environment with PasswordEncoder and UserRepository

2. **Test Coverage Implementation**
   - Implemented user registration tests:
     - Valid registration flow
     - Email format validation
     - Password complexity requirements (length, uppercase, lowercase, special characters)
     - Duplicate email handling
   
   - Implemented authentication tests:
     - Successful login with correct credentials
     - Failed login with incorrect password
     - Non-existent user handling
   
   - Implemented role management:
     - Role assignment functionality
     - Role validation
   
   - Implemented team management:
     - Team joining functionality
     - Team leaving functionality
     - Team membership validation

3. **Mock Implementation Details**
   - Used @Mock for PasswordEncoder and UserRepository
   - Implemented @InjectMocks for UserServiceImpl
   - Configured mock behaviors for:
     - Password encoding/verification
     - User existence checks
     - User persistence operations
     - Role and team management

4. **Test Implementation Results**
   - Successfully tested all UserService operations
   - Verified proper error handling
   - Ensured data persistence operations
   - Validated business logic implementation
   - Confirmed proper interaction between service and repository layers

The implementation demonstrates proper separation of concerns and comprehensive test coverage of the service layer functionality.
