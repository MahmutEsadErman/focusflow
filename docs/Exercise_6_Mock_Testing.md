# FocusFlow Mock Testing

## 6.1 Unit Testing of Models

We've analyzed the current test implementations for TaskTest, TeamTest, and UserTest using test design techniques from exercise five. Here's the approach:

### Analysis Methodology

Our analysis of the current test implementation followed a systematic approach to identify gaps in test coverage:

1. **Code Review**: We performed a detailed review of existing test cases for each component (User, Team, Task) to understand current coverage.

2. **Boundary Analysis**: We examined edge cases and boundary conditions that could potentially cause issues but weren't being tested.

3. **Use Case Mapping**: We mapped out all possible user interactions and system behaviors to identify untested scenarios.

4. **Error Path Analysis**: We analyzed error handling paths and exception cases that needed additional test coverage.

Through this comprehensive analysis, we identified several missing edge cases and test scenarios that need to be addressed:

### Findings and Missing Test Cases

1. **UserTest Analysis**
   
   - **Missing Tests**:
     - User creation with null values in optional fields
     - User creation with empty strings
     - User creation with maximum length values
     - Multiple role assignments
     - Task priority handling
     - Task deadline management

2. **TeamTest Analysis**

   - **Missing Tests**:
     - Team creation with null values
     - Team creation with empty strings
     - Team creation with maximum length values
     - Concurrent member modifications

3. **TaskTest Analysis**

   - **Missing Tests**:
     - Task creation with null values
     - Task creation with empty strings
     - Task creation with maximum length values


## 6.2 Service Testing

In this section, we implemented comprehensive testing for the UserService layer using Mockito. Here's what we accomplished:

1. **Service Layer Testing Setup**
   - Created UserService interface
   - Created UserServiceImpl to implement the interface
   - Implemented UserRepository for data persistence
   - Set up mock testing environment with PasswordEncoder and UserRepository

2. **Test Coverage Implementation**
   - Implemented user registration tests:
     - Valid registration flow
     - Email format validation
     - Password complexity requirements (length, uppercase, lowercase, special characters)
     - Duplicate email handling
   
   - Implemented authentication tests:
     - Successful login with correct credentials
     - Failed login with incorrect password
     - Non-existent user handling
   
   - Implemented role management:
     - Role assignment functionality
     - Role validation
   
   - Implemented team management:
     - Team joining functionality
     - Team leaving functionality
     - Team membership validation

3. **Mock Implementation Details**
   - Used @Mock for PasswordEncoder and UserRepository
   - Implemented @InjectMocks for UserServiceImpl
   - Configured mock behaviors for:
     - Password encoding/verification
     - User existence checks
     - User persistence operations
     - Role and team management

4. **Test Implementation Results**
   - Successfully tested all UserService operations
   - Verified proper error handling
   - Ensured data persistence operations
   - Validated business logic implementation
   - Confirmed proper interaction between service and repository layers

The implementation demonstrates proper separation of concerns and comprehensive test coverage of the service layer functionality.
