| **UX Factor**       | **aImportance**   | **b. Design/Feature Support in FocusFlow** | **c. Risk if Ignored**                                                                        |

| **Usefulness**      | Users  need to manage tasks efficiently. The tool must solve real problems and match their goals. | Smart task grouping, tagging, calendar integration, and deadlines help users get things done.  | If ignored, users may feel the app is irrelevant or a waste of time and abandon it.           |
| **Learnability**    | FocusFlow should be easy to understand for first-time users, as productivity tools are often used under time pressure.    | Onboarding tutorial, clean UI, intuitive icons, and minimal configuration required.            | New users may become frustrated or confused and leave the app before realizing its value.     |
| **Efficiency**      | Users want to complete task-related actions quickly (e.g., adding, organizing, filtering tasks).                          | Keyboard shortcuts, quick-add task feature, drag-and-drop task reordering.                     | If neglected, users may spend too much time managing tasks instead of completing them.        |
| **Trustworthiness** | Users need to feel their data (tasks, deadlines) are secure and accurately saved.                                         | Secure login, autosave functionality, visual confirmation (e.g., “Task saved”) and cloud sync. | Data loss or uncertainty about saving status can reduce confidence and harm user retention.   |
| **Aesthetics**      | A clean and attractive interface encourages prolonged and enjoyable usage.                                                | Use of consistent color schemes, whitespace, animations, and smooth transitions.               | A visually unappealing UI can cause negative emotional response and reduce perceived quality. |
