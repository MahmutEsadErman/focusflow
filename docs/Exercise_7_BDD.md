# FocusFlow Exercise 7 â€“ BDD & Gherkin Syntax

## Exercise 7.1 : User Stories Definition
In this part of the project, we focus on applying Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) principles to define and document user interactions with the FocusFlow application. Using the Gherkin syntax, we translate user stories into executable scenarios that describe the expected functionality from the user's perspective. These scenarios are stored in Focusflow.feature file located in the src/test/resources/features/ directory, following standard Java project conventions.
Task Management, Task Editing, Reminder Notifications, Task Prioritization, Team Collaboration, Productivity View are some features that are covered in the Gherkin scenarios.
Additionally, the pom.xml file is updated to include the necessary dependencies for the Cucumber BDD framework, ensuring a proper setup for writing and executing BDD tests.
